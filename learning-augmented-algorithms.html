  <h1>Lectures on Learning-Augmented Algorithms</h1>
  <h3>Antonios Antoniadis, September-October 2019</h3>

  <p> Classical algorithms are usually designed with worst-case
  performance guarantees in mind and do not adapt to 
  the actual inputs. On the other hand approaches based on Machine
  Learning are usually performing well in practice, specifically
  because they are able to adapt to inputs, but their perfromance in
  worst-case inputs can degrade significantly. </p>

  <p> In <em>learning-augmented algorithms</em> we are interested to
  design algorithms that may employ a
  machine-machine <em>predictor</em> in order to become adaptive to
  the input. Such a predictor will provide the algorithms with
  predictions (of unknown quality) about the actual input, and for the
  purpose of the algorithm designer the predictor can be seen as a
  black box.  The goal is to design an algorithm that incorporates
  these predictions and provide performance guarantees based on the
  quality of the predictions. Ideally, the performance should improve
  with the quality of the predictions, while even for predictions of
  very bad quality the algorithm performance should not degrade by too
  much (compared to the worst-case analysis).

  <p>Over three (or possibly four) lectures we will first introduce
  the relevant concepts, and then investigate how thisparadigm can be
  used to develop improved algorithms for specific problems. The focus
  will be mostly --but not exclusively-- on online problems.
 </p>

<big>The lectures will take place in Room 024, Max Planck Institute
  Building (E1.4), 15:30. Duration 75-90 minutes. </big>
